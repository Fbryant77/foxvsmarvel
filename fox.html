			Why Fox Should Keep Making X-Men Movies Instead of Marvel Studios

			With the release of X-Men: Days of Future Past, the film franchise that kicked off the current comic book movie craze in the year 2000 is officially back. Although X-Men: First Class was released in 2011, Days of Future Past brings Bryan Singer back in the director’s chair after the release of X2: X-Men United in 2003. While X-Men: Days Of Future Past is, in my opinion, the best movie in the entire franchise, it took Fox more than a decade to get its mojo back since the release of X2. It was well worth the wait to get to this point. So while I was watching the new movie, a thought popped in my head (as if Professor Xavier himself planted it in there in the first place) that Twentieth Century Fox is doing a great job making X-Men movies and the film franchise should never go back to Marvel Studios.

			Back in the mid-90s, Marvel Entertainment was on the verge of bankruptcy. To save the company, Marvel started to license their properties to movie studios to generate revenue. With Sony picking up everything Spider-Man, Universal taking The Hulk and Namor the Submariner, Fox bought the film rights to the X-Men universe and mutant mythology in 1994. In 1996, Fox hired Bryan Singer to develop and adapt the X-Men for a feature film that would be due in theaters during the summer of the year 2000. To Fox’s surprise, the film was a smash hit and started a trend in major motion pictures that lasts today, the comic book superhero movie genre.

			While Marvel Studios is at the height of all comic book superhero movies with Iron Man, Captain America, and The Avengers, Fox paved the way for their success with the X-Men movies. The movie studio has cut their teeth with good and bad X-Men movies that exist in their own cinematic universe. And I think that’s the key to why X-Men movies work better at Fox than they would at Marvel. Although there is a lot of online speculation, Fox has yet to expand and crossover the X-Men universe with their other comic book property, the Fantastic Four. While it’s the popular belief that there will be an X-Men/Fantastic Four crossover movie (though I really hope there isn’t), Fox has yet to make anything official. If Marvel Studios were making the X-Men films, the desire to crossover Wolverine with The Avengers would be too great and somehow less special.
